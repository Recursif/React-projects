## Gallery

This example shows how to render two different screens
(or the same screen in a different context) at the same url,
depending on how you got there.


Clicks the colors and see them full screen, then "visit the gallery"
and click on the colors. Note the URL and the component are
the same as before but  now we see them inside a modal
on top of the old screen.


parseInt(string, base);

base: entier entre 2 et 36
