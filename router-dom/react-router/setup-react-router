# Setting up modular routing with Express Router

Let's leave our happy React land and venture into a happy, but still
unexplored server side. Time for setting up server side routing.

All our routes are going to be located in routes folder.

Inside that folder there will be a separation by the kind of routes.

After creating a routes folder we are going to create api folder for api routes.

Then inisides the api folder let's create index.js file with the following content:

const express = require('express');

const apiRouter = express.Router();

copnst getLocations = (req,res) => {
  res.sendFile(process.cwd() + '/data/locations.json');
}

apiRouter.get('/locations', getLocations);

module.exports = apiRouter;

We are setting up an Express router with express.Router method.
