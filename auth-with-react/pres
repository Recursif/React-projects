# Intro 

ReactJS is a declrative, efficient and flexible Javascript 
library for building user interfaces.

ReactJS makes it easy for you to build your web 
applications in the form of encapsulated components that 
manage their own state.

## Understanding key concepts in ReactJS 

ReactJS was influenced by XHP, an augmentation 
of PHP and Hack to allow XML syntax for the 
purpose of creating custom and reusable HTML elements.

There are many questions you might have to ask yourself,
such as:

Why are JavaScript and HTML together in one script?
What is JSX? Why is the syntax so weird?
What is a state?
Why do we need props?
What are and why do we need components in our apps?

These key concepts are:

Components - The Types and API
Props
State
JSX


## Components - The types and API 

React is basically about components. 
A ReactJS app is just one big component made up of interoperable smaller components.

Working with ReactJS means you are thinking in components most of the time.

class CustomComponent extends React.Component {
   render() {
      return '<h3> This is my custom component!!!</h3>';
   }
}


React provides some methods that are triggered at various points from creating a component up 
until the component is destroyed.

This is called the Components's Lifecycle.

You can declare methods to hook into the components's lifecylce to control behavior 
of the components in your app.

Some examples of these lifecycle hooks are componentDidMount(), componentWillMount(), componentWillUnmount(), shouldComponentUpdate(), componentWillUpdate() and more.

componentWillMount(): This method is called before the component is initially rendered.

So it is called before the render method is executed.

You can't perform any type of DOM manipulation here because the component isn't available 
in the DOM yet.


componentDidMount(): This method is called right after the component has been rendered.

So it is called immediately after the render method has been executed. It's the best place 
to perform network and AJAX calls.


componentWillUnmount(): This method is called right before the components is removed from 
the DOM.

shouldComponentUpdate(): This method determines if a re-rendering should occur or not.
It is never called on initial rendering and it's always called before the render method.

componentWillUpdate(): This method is called as soon as shouldComponentUpdate returns true.
It is just before the component is rendered with new data 

There are also methods like render and setState that you can use to render an element on the DOM and set the state of a component respectively.

import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { render } from 'react-dom';

class Experiment extends Component {

  componentWillMount() {
    console.log("This will mount");
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    console.log("This did mount");
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    console.log("This will unmount");
  }

  render() {
    console.log("I am just rendering like a boss");
    return <div>I got rendered!</div>;
  }

}

render(
  <Experiment />,
  document.getElementById("root")
);


## Props

Props is the short form for properties.
Properties are attributes of a component.

In fact, props are how component talk to each other.

A tag in HTML such as image has an attribute, prop called src that points to the 
location of an image.

In React, you can have two components, FatherComponent and SonComponent.

Let's see how they can talk to each other.

class FatherComponent extends Component {
      render() {
      return <SonComponent quality="eye balls" />;
   }
}


class SonComponent extends Component {
    render() {
      return <p> I am a true son. I have my father's "{ this.props.quality }" . </p>;
    }
}

## State 


When developping ReactJS applications, it is important to know when and when not to 
use state in components.

The question now is: When do I use State?, When do I use props?

Props are dara that the components depends on to render correctly.


Most of the times, it comes from above, meaning it is passed down 
from a parent component to a child component.

Like props, state holds information about the component but it is 
handle differently. For example, the number of times a button was clicked, user input 
from a form, etc.

When state changes in a component, the component automatically re-renders and updates the DOM.

Inside a component, state is managed using a setState function.


class Layout extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = {
      position: "right"
    };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      { this.state.position }
    )
  }
}


class Button extends Component {
    constructor() {
        super()
        this.state = {
            count: 0
        }
    }

    updateCount() {
        this.setState((prevState, props) => {
            return { count: prevState.count +1 }
        })
    }

    render() {
        return (
            <button onClick{() => this.updateCount()} >
                Clicked {this.state.count} times
            </button>
        )
    }
}
