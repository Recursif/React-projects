React expects that the rendered content is
identical between the server and the client.
It can patch up differences in text content,
but you should treat mismatches as bugs and fix them.

In dev mode, react warns about mismatches during hydratation.
There are no guarantees that attribute differences will be
patched up in case of mismatches.

This is important for performance reasons because in most apps,
mismatches are rare, and so validating all markup would be
prohibilively expensive.
