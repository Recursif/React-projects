# Creating Charges

Use Stripe's API and
your server-side code process charges.

Once you've securely collected and tokenized your
customer's credit card using Checkout, you can charge the card
immediately or save it for later.

Unlike tokenization, which occurs in the browser, charge attempts
are made from your server, normally using one of our client librairies.

If you haven't already, install the library for our favorite language now.

On your server, grab the Stripe token in the POST parameters
submitted by your form.

From there, it's one simple API call to charge the card:


// See your secret key: remember to change this to your live secret key in prod
// See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/apikeys
var stripe = require("stripe")("sk_test_xTRwMutg2xbAqkmaucLHOClH");

// Token is created using Checkout or Elements!
// Get the payment token ID submitted by the form:
const token = request.body.stripeToken; // Using Express

const charge = stripe.charges.create({
  amount: 999,
  currency: 'usd',
  description: 'Example charge',
  source: token,
});



As a convenience, if you're logged in while reading this page,
we've pre-filled the example with your test secret API key.
Only you can see this value. This will authenticate you to Stripe,
so keep it secret and keep it safe. Remember to replace the test key
with your live key in production. You can get all your keys from
the Dashboard.

That’s it! If the charge creation request succeeds, the card has been successfully charged.

You will automatically receive your money in seven days. If the charge attempt fails, we’ll return an error instead.
