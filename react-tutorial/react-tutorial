## What is React

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible
Javascript library for building user interfaces.

React has a few different kinds of components,
but we'll start with React.Component.

class ShoppingList extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="shopping-list">
        <h1>Shopping List for {this.props.name}</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Instagram</li>
          <li>WhapsApp</li>
          <li>Oculus</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    )
  }
}


Components tell React what to render - then React
will efficiently update and render just the right
components when your data changes.

Here, ShoppingList is a React component class,
or React component type. A component takes in parameters,
called props, and returns a hierarchy of views to display
via the render method.

Render return React element, which is a lightweight
description of what to render.

The shoppingList component only render built-in DOM
components, but you can compose custom React components just as easily,
by writing <ShoppingList />. Each component is encapsulated so it can
operate independently, which allows you to build complex UIs out of
simple components.



## Get started

3 components :
- Square
- Board
- Game

The Square component renders a single <button/>,

the Board renders 9 squares, and the Game component renders a board with
some placeholders that we'll fill in later.



## Passing Data Through Props
